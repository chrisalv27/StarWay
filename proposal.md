# StarWay

## Project Overview
Starway is a astrology application that can be used as a source of information for anyone interested in astrology.  Starway aims to give the user a basic start to understanding their sign as well as their interactions to other signs in the zodiac.  The information can taken to a proffesional reader or shared with peers.  The information can also be used as a starting point to someone looking into astrology as a interest, hobby, or career.

## Features
As a user, I want to be able to see my zodiac sign and description because it is a interest to see how it interacts with other people in my family or circle of friends.

As a user, I want to be able to see my birth chart and be able to take it to a professional astrologer for a in-depth reading.
