# StarWay

## Project Overview
Starway is a astrology application that can be used as a source of information for anyone interested in astrology.  Starway aims to give the user a basic start to understanding their sign as well as their interactions to other signs in the zodiac.  The information can taken to a proffesional reader or shared with peers.  The information can also be used as a starting point to someone looking into astrology as a interest, hobby, or career.
